Forms are the space to register your data to have control about any register in a database context, we usually use forms to create data in our database and we can manage this information to different outcomes.

In this project we use to make forms into the framework Ruby on Rails, to practice the different ways to create a form and having a glace about how the server and the client interact with methods from the terminal.

Feel free to add more features when you use or clone this repository.
