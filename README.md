Forms are the space to register your data to have a control about any register in a database context, we usually use forms to create data in our database and we can manange this information to different outcomes.

In this project we use make forms into the framework Ruby on Rails, to practice about the different ways to create a form and having a glace about how the server and the client interact with methods from the terminal.



## Built With 🔨
